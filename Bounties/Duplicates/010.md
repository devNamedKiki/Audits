# Borrower can byPass credit cap for unlimited borrowing power

## Summary 

The protocol allowed users to borrow funds; however, only up to a certain limit, enforced by a cap. As they borrowed funds, the cap would lower, limiting how much they could borrow. When repaying funds, the cap would grow. The protocol also often truncated input amounts if the inputted amount was not possible. For example, if a user passed in 1000 USDC but only had 600 USDC, the protocol would truncate the amount to 600. This was generally acceptable; however, the order in which they updated the cap and truncated the amount was incorrect in certain cases. As a result, a user could input an arbitrarily large amount on repayment, raise their cap to that amount, and only repay the truncated amount. At this point, the user would be able to borrow an unlimited amount.


## Conclusion 

Report was a duplicte.
