# Attacker Can Front-Run Fund Function to Harvest Rewards Early

## Summary 

The protocol allowed sponsors to initiate campaigns on their platform where they could provide rewards to users over a fixed amount of time. The vulnerability stemmed from the fact that as the time left in the reward period neared 0, all the remaining rewards would be distributed to the claimable pool. If a sponsor were to extend the reward period during this time, an attacker could front-run the sponsor and stake a large amount of funds. After the sponsor's transaction completes, the attacker could claim most, if not all, of the recently added rewards, even though they were meant to be distributed over the upcoming period.

## Conclusion 

Report was a duplicte.
