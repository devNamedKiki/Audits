# First depositor attack on when new reserve is initiated

## Summary 

The protocol allowed for the minting of zero shares in exchange for a non-zero amount of funds. Due to this and other missing checks, an attacker could front-run the first depositor and cause them to deposit funds in exchange for no shares, allowing the attacker to keep all funds for themselves.

What was especially impactful about this instance of a first depositor attack was that the share calculation involved an exchange rate instead of the protocol's balance. Consequently, an attack only required a couple of dollars to ensure that they could steal any amount of funds from the upcoming depositor.


## Conclusion 

Report was a duplicte.
