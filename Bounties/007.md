# Attacker Can Brick Operations In and Out of GMX

## Summary 

The protocol allows users to interact with GMX through their protocol; however, it had a cap on the amount of funds that could be sent to and brought from GMX. This cap should not have been hit with typical behavior. However, an attacker would have been able to leverage the asynchronous nature of GMX to cause unexpected reverts, which the protocol did not have logic to handle. In such cases, the cap would have been artificially met, preventing deposit and withdraw interactions with GMX.

## Conclusion 

The protocol quickly confirmed and fixed the issue.
