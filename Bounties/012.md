# Reward tokens are locked if no claimers at any point during the period

## Summary 

The protocol has a reward system where funds in the reward pool are allocated to shareholders based on a predetermined rate. For example, if the reward pool had 10,000 USDC in the vault and was meant to be distributed over the course of 100 days, 100 USDC would be distributed per day. Because the rate is fixed, if there are ever no stakers for one of the numerous reward pools, the rewards meant to be distributed during that period will become locked permanently. So at the end of the reward period, these funds will not be accessible by any party. This includes the protocol, as there was no way to rescue unclaimed rewards.

## Conclusion 

Validated as a medium, protocol chose not to fix.
