# Attacker Can Steal and/or Lock Funds With Elastic Supply Tokens

## Summary 

The protocol had vaults that were designed to handle rebase tokens and it did in most cases. However, an attacker could still exploit the change in supply by precisely performing a sequence of stakes and unstakes to force the vault into a state where it no longer responds to balance changes from external parties (rebases). At this point, the attacker would be able to game the rebase every day and steal funds from other users or lock funds depending on whether the rebase grew or shrank the vault's balance.

## Conclusion 

Protocol confirmed and chose to monitor the vulnerability as the fix involved large design changes to their vaults.
