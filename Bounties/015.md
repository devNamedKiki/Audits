# Attacker Can lock all funds

## Summary 

The protocol intereacts with GMX via deposits and withdrawals. When liquidations occur a forced withdrawl is made on the users behalf. Because GMX has a keeper system and is asynchronous the liquidation would not be completed in the same trasnaction. The attacker would of been able to take advantage of this by liquidating the same position over and over all in one trasnaction, each time pulling GM tokens from the vault and sending it to GMX. Only the first transaction would be succsesful while the rest would revert in the callback leading leaving all the funds locked in that contract. What made this attack very interesting was that the accounting of users positions didnt change, and any attempt to put funds back in the protocol would further break the state making the protocol unusable. 

## Conclusion 

The Protocol quickly confirmed and fixed the issue.
