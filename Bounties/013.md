# Attacker Can Liquidate all healthy positions

## Summary 

The protocol allowed users to permissionlessly leverage borrow from their vaults as well as liquidate other users. Typically, a user could not liquidate another user who had a healthy position. However, there was access control missing on the function that determined the liquidation threshold, allowing any users to change the liquidation threshold to a value that would make any user's position appear unhealthy and eligible for liquidation. 

## Conclusion 

The Protocol quickly confirmed and fixed the issue.
