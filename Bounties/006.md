# Attacker Can Steal From Options Writers

## Summary 

The protocol was an options market that allowed users to permissionlessly supply funds to the protocol and become an option writer. Upon doing so, they received a percentage of the premiums, potentially incurring the responsibility to payout for an in-the-money (ITM) option. The protocol implemented a locking period of 1 week to prevent users from collecting premiums and then withdrawing before paying out the options. However, there was a flaw in their logic that allowed an attacker to exploit this system. 

The attacker could calculate, a few seconds before the expiry of the options, if they were ITM or not. If they were not, the attacker could deposit funds before the option expired, collect premiums for the entire next week, and just before the next expiry, calculate if the options were in the money. If so, they could withdraw all funds, as they were staked for a full week. By doing so, the attacker would have been able to quietly receive premiums while shifting all the risk onto the other option writers.


## Conclusion 

The protocol confirmed the issue, however was moving to v2 soon and opted not to fix it.
