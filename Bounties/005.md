# Attacker Can DoS the Settlement of Options

## Summary 

This protocol was an options market that would mint an ERC-721 to the option buyers. At the expiry of the option, whoever was the owner of the ERC-721 would be entitled to the profit made from the option. Due to the batch system used for paying out options, if one payout failed, all options would be bricked indefinitely. The vulnerability I found was that if an attacker transferred their ERC-721 to a blacklisted USDC address, the protocol would not be able to pay out to that address, resulting in a denial-of-service (DoS) for all users.


## Conclusion 

The protocol confirmed the issue, however was moving to v2 soon and opted not to fix it.
