# Once reward token is removed users wont have access to their yield.


## Summary
Admin are able to remove tokens from the reward list in removeExternalRewardToken(). This is excpected to be done when rewards are not being offered anymore from external sources or internal.

When an admin removes a token they are taken off of the reward list and wont be accessible when attempting to claim rewards.

The issue with this is that if a user has earned x amount of token B as one of the external reward tokens. When the admin removes that token that user no longer has access to thier share of token B. Meaning the erwards they earned are now locked away with no way of retrieving them. Currently there is no guarentee that users will know when this change is goign to occur. Which can lead to users being blind sided by the change and unable to retrieve their entitiled yield.

## Vulnerability details
See above


## Impact
Loss of yield for users when token is removed and users have not yet claimed.

Manual Review


## Recommended Mitigation Steps

I think a timelock where users are given enough time to retrieve their funds would be a good enough solution.
