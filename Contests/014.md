# Some ERC20 tokens revert on 0 transfer

## Impact
Some ERC20 tokens revert on transfer  when the value being transferd is 0. Tokens such as LEND have this extra restriction and would cause functionality in the pool to break. Whenever fees are 0 users wont be able to access the Change() function. This broken functionality will limit what a users can do in the pool. Having a token like lend in a private pool is reasonable as the token is relativly well know. The extra functionality in lend would cause a key function in Private pool to revert. 


## Proof of Concept
The easiest way to test this to is to add this code snippet to ShibaInu.sol
```solidity!
file: ShibaInu.sol


contract LEND is ERC20 {
    mapping(address => uint256) balances;

    constructor() ERC20("LEND", "lend", 18) {}

    function transferFrom(
        address src,
        address dst,
        uint wad
    ) public override returns (bool) {
        require(balances[dst] + wad > balances[dst]);
        return super.transferFrom(src, dst, wad);
    }

    function transfer(address dst, uint wad) public override returns (bool) {
        require(balances[dst] + wad > balances[dst]);
        return super.transfer(dst, wad);
    }
}

```

Then add this snippet to Fixture.sol
``` solidity
file: Fixture.sol

    LEND public lend = new LEND();

```

Lastly add and run this test in Change.t.sol
```solidity!
file: Change.t.sol

    // run: forge test --match-test test_changeWithZeroFee --ffi
    function test_changeWithZeroFee() public {
        privatePool = new PrivatePool(
            address(factory),
            address(royaltyRegistry),
            address(stolenNftOracle)
        );
        privatePool.initialize(
            address(lend),
            nft,
            virtualBaseTokenReserves,
            virtualNftReserves,
            0,
            feeRate,
            merkleRoot,
            true,
            false
        );

        milady.setApprovalForAll(address(privatePool), true);
        lend.approve(address(privatePool), type(uint256).max);

        inputTokenIds.push(0);
        inputTokenIds.push(1);
        inputTokenIds.push(2);

        milady.mint(address(privatePool), 10);
        milady.mint(address(privatePool), 11);
        milady.mint(address(privatePool), 12);
        outputTokenIds.push(10);
        outputTokenIds.push(11);
        outputTokenIds.push(12);
        (uint256 feeAmount, ) = privatePool.changeFeeQuote(
            outputTokenIds.length * 1e18
        );
        deal(address(lend), address(this), feeAmount);

        vm.expectRevert();
        privatePool.change(
            inputTokenIds,
            inputTokenWeights,
            inputProof,
            stolenNftProofs,
            outputTokenIds,
            outputTokenWeights,
            outputProof
        );
    }

```

## Recommended Mitigation Steps

In the change function prior to transfering feeAmount from `msg.sender` to the pool. There should be a check that confirms that fee amount is greater than 0. This would prevent any zero transfers from occuring. And allow the change() function to work as intended with tokens that revert on zero transfers.
