# Unsafe Transfer of arbitrary erc20 tokens.

## Summary

There are multiple instances where the protocol is using `transfer` and `transferFrom`. some tokens do not revert on failure or return `true` when it is successful.

## Vulnerability Detail

Because users can create a cooler with any erc20 token it is more than possible for certain coolers to not function properly.

## Impact

Tokens that do not conform to erc20 standard (e.g. USDT, BNB, OMG) can fail and the protocol would not be able to handle it correctly.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

Use Oz's safe erc20 or other safe transfer options. As opposed to just `transfer` and `transferFrom`
