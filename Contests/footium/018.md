# Buyer of club owner can be frontrun by owner of club

## Summary
If the club owner lists their club on the secondary market and a buyer attempts to buy the club. The club owner can front run the purchase and trade all of the players to one of their other clubs. Because the players are a large part of what brings that club value the owner can essentially trick the buyer into overpaying for a club.


## Vulnerability details
Given that there are no restrictions on trading clubs on the secondary market, the following scenario could occur:

Alice has a club worth 10 eth.
9 of that eth comes the players value.
Alice list the club on a secondary market for 10 eth
Bob attempts to buy the club for the fair price of 10 eth
Alice sees this transaction and front runs it and transfers all the players (9 eth worth) to her other club.
Bobs transaction finishes and he receives a club with no players. (now valued at 1 eth)
Bob spent 10 eth and for what should of been a 10 eth club but got a 1 eth club instead.
Alice now has 10 eth + 9 eth worth of players.

## Impact
Buyers can loose funds on secondary markets due to malicious club owners.
