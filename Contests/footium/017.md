# Unsafe transfer of arbitrary erc20 token


## Summary
The `claimERC20Prize` function in the contract lacks a safe transfer method for the ERC20 token that the user is claiming as a prize. The lack of a safe transfer method could lead to the user not receiving their prize while the state of the contract is updated as if the funds were successfully sent.





## Vulnerability details
The `claimERC20Prize` function allows users to claim ERC20 tokens as a prize from the contract. However, there is a vulnerability in this function because it does not use the safe transfer method when transferring tokens to the user. This lack of a safe transfer method means that users may not receive their prize, but the contract will still update the state as if the funds were successfully sent.

To demonstrate this vulnerability, consider Alice and Bob. Alice is a user who wants to claim a prize of 100 ERC20 tokens from the contract.

Alice calls the `claimERC20Prize` function with the necessary parameters to claim her prize. The function checks that Alice is the receiver and that the merkle proof is valid. The function then calculates the value of the ERC20 tokens to transfer to Alice and calls `_token.transfer(_to, value)` to transfer the tokens. However, because the function does not use the safe transfer method, the transfer may fail silently. Alice will not receive her prize. However, the contract will still update its state as if the tokens were transferred successfully. Meaning she will not be able to try and transfer her tokens again because the state says that Alice already claimed.


## Impact
This vulnerability impacts users who try to claim their prize through the `claimERC20Prize` function. Users who fall victim to this vulnerability may not receive their prize, and the state of the contract will be updated as if the tokens were successfully transferred. This is a loss of funds vulnerability.

Manual Review


## Recommended Mitigation Steps
To mitigate this vulnerability, we recommend using a open zeppelins (or similar) safe transfer method when transferring arbitrary ERC20 tokens to users.
