# Royalty recipients will not get fair share of royalties

## Impact

Recipients of NFTs who accept royalties will not get their fair share of royalties. This is because royalties is calculated by dividing the sales price equally amongst all sold NFT's in that purchase. The issue with this is that it assumes all NFT's cost the same amount when it comes time to deal out royalties. If NFT's cost differnt amounts then they should be getting a amount of royalties based on that weight relative to the other NFT's. the impact of this is that Royalties will not be distributed evenly at the expense of the more expensive NFT. Meaning that recipients of the expensive NFT will always recieve less then they are owed. And the cheaper ones will get more than owed. In short the is a loss of funds or misdistribution of funds. 
## Proof of Concept

The easyiest way to test this will to be add this snippet into Milady.sol

Using this to have access to ERC2981's `setRoyaltyInfo()`
``` solidity
file: Milady.sol
    function setRoyaltyInfo(
        uint256 _royaltyFeeRate,
        address _royaltyRecipient
    ) public {
        royaltyFeeRate = _royaltyFeeRate;
        royaltyRecipient = _royaltyRecipient;
    }

    function supportsInterface(
        bytes4 interfaceId
    ) public view override(ERC2981, ERC721) returns (bool) {
        return super.supportsInterface(interfaceId);
    }

    function royaltyInfo(
        uint256 id,
        uint256 salePrice
    ) public view override returns (address, uint256) {
        return super.royaltyInfo(id, salePrice);
    }

    function setRoyaltyInfo(uint256 id, address reciever, uint96 fee) public {
        super._setTokenRoyalty(id, reciever, fee);
    }
}

```

Then add this snippet to Fixture.sol
``` solidity
file: Fixture.sol

    GodsUnchained public gu = new GodsUnchained();

```
Then add this snippet to token-weights.json

Changing the weights to represent the two NFT's nbeing bought in this case
``` json
[
  [
    1,
    1
  ],
  [
    2,
    10
  ]
]
```

Lastly to test this you need to add this test to Buy.t.sol
``` solidity
    // forge test --match-test test_unevenRoyalties --ffi
    function test_unevenRoyalties() public {
        // arrange
        privatePool = new PrivatePool(
            address(factory),
            address(royaltyRegistry),
            address(stolenNftOracle)
        );
        privatePool.initialize(
            baseToken,
            address(gu),
            virtualBaseTokenReserves,
            12e18,
            changeFee,
            feeRate,
            generateMerkleRoot(),
            true,
            true
        );
        //> owner of nft's
        address user1 = address(0xbeefbeef);
        address user2 = address(0xfeebfeeb);

        //> mint and push nft's one is 1x one is 10x
        gu.mint(address(privatePool), 1);
        tokenIds.push(1);
        tokenWeights.push(1e18);

        gu.mint(address(privatePool), 2);
        tokenIds.push(2);
        tokenWeights.push(10e18);

        //> set fees. 1% for one user, 10% for the other
        gu.setRoyaltyInfo(1, user1, 100);
        gu.setRoyaltyInfo(2, user2, 1000);

        //> set up
        proofs = generateMerkleProofs(tokenIds, tokenWeights);
        uint256 weightSum = privatePool.sumWeightsAndValidateProof(
            tokenIds,
            tokenWeights,
            proofs
        );
        (uint256 netInputAmount, , ) = privatePool.buyQuote(weightSum);

        //> buy
        privatePool.buy{value: netInputAmount * 2}( //> need to do * 2 due to a different bug.
            tokenIds,
            tokenWeights,
            proofs
        );

        //> assert that users got equal reserves. with different weights and royalty fees users should NOT be getting the same amount of royalties
        //> the royalty fee of user2 is 10 times greater than user one. This shows that user2 is getting 10 times as much royaltys when user 2 should be getting 100 times as much as user one.
        //> user 1: 1% of 1 eth = 0.01 eth
        //> user 2: 10% of 10 eth = 1 eth
        //> 0.01 eth * 100 = 1eth.
        //> user 2 should be getting 100 times more royalties than user 1 but is only getting 10 times the amount.
        assertEq(user1.balance * 10, address(user2).balance);
    }

## Recommended Mitigation Steps


Royalty recipients will not get their entitled amount of royalties. When determining royalties the weight of the NFT relative to the other ones being bought need to be taken into consideration.
