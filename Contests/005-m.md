## Vulnerability details

## Impact

Detailed description of the impact of this finding.

In FixedPrice.sol there are only two ways for the seller or saleReciever to get there funds from the contract. This being by ending the sale. The first way to end the sale would be to cancel it.
This is only possible prior to the sale starting. e.g. (A Fixed Proce sale is created with a starttime of 3:00pm.
The function Cancel will only execute prior to 3:00pm).

The only other way of ending the sale is if newID == sale\_.finalID. Meaning the only other way for the seller to recieve there funds would be if every eddition is sold. This can be a problem and lead to locked funds if supply is greater than demand.

For example:
If Alice was selling a collection of dalamtions for 1 eth each and had 101 editions.
She would excpet to make 101 eth when all editions are sold. However, if Alice only sells 100 dalmations.
There will be 100 eth locked in the contract until all editions are sold. These funds could be locked for 1 day, 1 month, 1 year or possibly forever.
Alice would have sold 100 editions earned 100 eth but have access to that eth becasue the would be open indefinitely.

## Recommended Mitigation Steps

There are a few ways to mitiagte this issue. The easiest way to do so without disrupting the existing code would be to add a withdraw function that sends the contracts balance to the saleReciever. This way the seller can withdraw thier existing earned funds at any point during the sale.
