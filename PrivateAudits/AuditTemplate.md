## 1. About Kiki

I am an independent smart contract security researcher. With a background in Computer Science and Business. I strive to provide thorough and quality service in every audit I partake in. To read more about me you may visit my [github](https://github.com/devNamedKiki/Audits), [twitter](https://twitter.com/Kiki_developer), and [linkedin](https://www.linkedin.com/in/kiki-brown-2191a525b/).

## 2. Disclaimer

> A smart contract security review can never verify the complete absence of vulnerabilities. This is a time, resource and expertise bound effort where I try to find as many vulnerabilities as possible.

> This report is not, nor should be considered, an “endorsement” or “disapproval” of any particular project or team. This report is not, nor should be considered, an indication of the economics or value of any “product” or “asset” created by any team or project that contracts Kiki to perform a security assessment. This report does not provide any warranty or guarantee regarding the absolute bug-free nature of the technology analyzed, nor do they provide any indication of the technologies proprietors, business, business model or legal compliance.
> 
> This report should not be used in any way to make decisions around investment or involvement with any particular project. This report in no way provides investment advice, nor should be leveraged as investment advice of any sort. This report represents an extensive assessing process intending to help our customers increase the quality of their code while reducing the high level of risk presented by cryptographic tokens and blockchain technology.
> 
> Blockchain technology and cryptographic assets present a high level of ongoing risk. Kiki's position is that each company and individual are responsible for their own due diligence and continuous security. Kiki’s goal is to help reduce the attack vectors and the high level of variance associated with utilizing new and consistently changing technologies, and in no way claims any guarantee of security or functionality of the technology we agree to analyze.
> 
> The assessment services provided by Kiki is subject to dependencies and under continuing
> development. You agree that your access and/or use, including but not limited to any services, reports, and materials, will be at your sole risk on an as-is, where-is, and as-available basis. Cryptographic tokens are emergent technologies and carry with them high levels of technical risk and uncertainty. The assessment reports could include false positives, false negatives, and other unpredictable results. The services may access, and depend upon, multiple layers of third-parties.
> 
> Notice that smart contracts deployed on the blockchain are not resistant from internal/external exploit. Notice that active smart contract owner privileges constitute an elevated impact to any smart contract’s safety and security. Therefore, Kiki does not guarantee the explicit security of the audited smart contract, regardless of the verdict.

## 3. Risk Classification

|        | High     | Medium | Low    |
| ------ | -------- | ------ | ------ |
| High   | Critical | High   | Medium |
| Medium | High     | Medium | Low    |
| Low    | Medium   | Low    | Low    |

### 3.1 Impact

- High
  - Leads to a significant material loss of assets in the protocol or significantly harms a group of users.
- Medium
  - Only a small amount of funds can be lost or a core functionality of the protocol is affected.
- Low
  - Any kind of unexpected behaviour with some of the protocol's functionalities.

### 3.2 Likelihood

- High
  - Almost certain to happen, easy to perform, or not easy but highly incentivizaed.
- Medium
  - Only conditionally possible or incentivized, but still relatively incentivized.
- Low
  - Little incentive and would need extra ordinary events to occur for this to happen.

### 3.3 Action Required

- Critical
  - Must fix as soon as possible (if already deployed)
- High
  - Must fix
- Medium
  - Should fix
- Low
  - Could fix
