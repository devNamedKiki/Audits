## 1. About Kiki

I am an independent smart contract security researcher. With a background in Computer Science and Business. I strive to provide thorough and quality service in every audit I partake in. To read more about me you may visit my [github](https://github.com/devNamedKiki/Audits), [twitter](https://twitter.com/Kiki_developer), and [linkedin](https://www.linkedin.com/in/kiki-brown-2191a525b/).

## 2. Disclaimer

A smart contract security review can never verify the complete absence of vulnerabilities. This is a time, resource and expertise bound effort where I try to find as many vulnerabilities as possible. I can not guarantee 100% security after the review or even if the review will find any problems with your smart contracts.

## 3. Risk Classification

|        | High     | Medium | Low    |
| ------ | -------- | ------ | ------ |
| High   | Critical | High   | Medium |
| Medium | High     | Medium | Low    |
| Low    | Medium   | Low    | Low    |

### 3.1 Impact

- High
  - Leads to a significant material loss of assets in the protocol or significantly harms a group of users.
- Medium
  - Only a small amount of funds can be lost or a core functionality of the protocol is affected.
- Low
  - Any kind of unexpected behaviour with some of the protocol's functionalities.

### 3.2 Likelihood

- High
  - Almost certain to happen, easy to perform, or not easy but highly incentivizaed.
- Medium
  - Only conditionally possible or incentivized, but still relatively incentivized.
- Low
  - Little incentive and would need extra ordinary events to occur for this to happen.

### 3.3 Action Required

- Critical
  - Must fix as soon as possible (if already deployed)
- High
  - Must fix
- Medium
  - Should fix
- Low
  - Could fix

## 4. Executive Summary
